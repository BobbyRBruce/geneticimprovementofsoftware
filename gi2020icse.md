## Call For Submissions [[pdf](https://github.com/geneticimprovementofsoftware/geneticimprovementofsoftware.github.io/raw/master/cfp.pdf)]

We invite submissions that discuss recent developments in all areas of research on, and applications of, Genetic Improvement. 
GI is the premier workshop in the field and provides an opportunity for researchers interested in automated program repair and software optimisation to disseminate their work, exchange ideas and discover new research directions.
Topics of interest include both the theory and practice of Genetic Improvement. Applications include, but are not limited to, using GI to:

•	improve efficiency

•	decrease memory consumption

•	decrease energy consumption

•	transplant new functionality

•	specialise software

•	translate between programming languages

•	generate multiple versions of software

•	repair bugs

## Research & Position Papers
We invite submissions of two paper types:

•	Research papers (limit 8 pages)

•	Position papers (limit 2 pages)

We encourage authors to submit early and in-progress work. The workshop emphasises interaction and discussion.
All papers should be submitted via HotCRP:
<https://icse20-gi8.hotcrp.com/>
double-blind as pdfs (in the [ACM conference format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) as per the [ICSE 2020 information](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2020/icse-2020-papers#Call-for-Papers)) [[download LaTeX template](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-master.zip)].
> LaTeX users must use the provided `acmart.cls` and `ACM-Reference-Format.bst` *without modification*, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e., `\documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}`), and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e., `\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}`). The review option adds line numbers, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments.

All accepted papers must be presented at GI 2020 and will appear in the ICSE workshops volume. The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is the date the proceedings are made available online.

## Keynote

We are happy to announce that Mark Harman (Facebook, University College London) will give the keynote talk.

## Studentships

There will be up to five travel scholarships available for students whose work is accepted at the workshop.
