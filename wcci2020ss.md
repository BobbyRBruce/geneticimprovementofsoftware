## **Special Session on Genetic Improvement @[WCCI 2020](https://wcci2020.org)**

![](./misc_images/wcci2020glasgow.jpeg)

The Special Session on Genetic Improvement will be held at the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC), part of the IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence [WCCI](https://wcci2020.org), 2020, Glasgow, Scotland, in **July 2020**. 

## Overview
In the past ten years there has been a dramatic increase in work on Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE), an approach to software engineering in which search-based optimisation algorithms are used to address problems. The approach is attractive because it offers a suite of adaptive automated and semi-automated solutions in situations typified by large complex problem spaces with multiple competing and conflicting objectives. 

An increasingly popular area similar to SBSE, called  [Genetic Improvement of Software](./faq.html), arised in the last few years. With this special session, we are providing an opportunity to showcase recent breakthroughs in this field.

## Call For Papers


We invite submissions on any aspect of Genetic Improvement of Software, including, but not limited to, theoretical results and interesting new applications. The suggested topics cover the entire range of optimisation of functional and non-functional properties:
- bandwidth minimisation
- latency minimisation
- fitness optimisation
- energy optimisation
- software specialisation
- memory optimisation
- software transplantation
- software testing
- bug fixing
- multi-objective code optimisation

In the context of WCCI, we also welcome ANN and Fuzzy based approaches to support GI, e.g. in performance prediction, identifying buggy code, estimating run times, etc.

## Important Dates

 - Paper Submission Deadline: 15 Jan 2020
 - Notification of Acceptance: 15 Mar 2020
 - Final Paper Submission Deadline: 15 Apr 2020

## Paper Submission

Papers for IEEE CEC 2020 should be submitted electronically through the [Congress website](https://wcci2020.org/calls/#call-for-papers), and will be refereed by experts in the fields and ranked based on the criteria of originality, significance, quality and clarity. To submit your papers to the special session, please select the Special Session name in the Main Research topic.

For more submission information please visit: (https://wcci2020.org). All accepted papers will be published in the IEEE CEC 2020 electronic proceedings, included in the IEEE Xplore digital library, and indexed by EI Compendex.

## Organisers

[Alexander (Sandy) Brownlee](http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~sbr/) is a Lecturer in the Division of Computing Science and Mathematics at the University of Stirling. His main topics of interest are in search-based optimisation methods and machine learning, with applications in civil engineering, transportation and SBSE. Within SBSE, he is interested in automated bug-fixing and improvement of non-functional properties such as run-time and energy consumption; how these different objectives interact with each other; and novel approaches to mutating code. He is also one of the developers of Gin, an open-source toolkit for experimentation with Genetic Improvement on real-world software projects.
